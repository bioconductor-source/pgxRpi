The "example.pgxseg" dataset serves as a toy data illustration. The ".pgxseg" data format, used in the Progenetix database, is a specialized version of a standard tab-separated columnar text file. It is commonly generated by array or sequencing CNV software. This format includes an optional metadata header that includes instructions for tasks such as plotting or grouping. More details about this data format can be found in the documentation available at https://docs.progenetix.org/file-formats/?h=.pgxseg#progenetix-file-formats.

The "datatable_mappings.yaml" file is a configuration file that defines the mapping of terms from the Progenetix Beaconplus API responses, ensuring that the retrieved data is accurately translated into structured data frames. It is based on the `definitions/datatable_mappings.yaml` from progenetix/bycon repository with some modifications.
